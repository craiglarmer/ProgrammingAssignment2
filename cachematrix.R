## Function to create a matrix that has caching Solve functionality
## the cache will increase performance at the cost of storage

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Return the inverse of a matrix from a cached matrix
## if the inverse has been calculated previously it will return the cached version

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
}
